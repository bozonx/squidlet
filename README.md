# Squidlet

Easy make IoT devices and local net of devices which can be managed by master


## Environment variables

* ROOT_DIR - if set then it will be a default root dir for all the other dirs.
  It can be absolute or relative to PWD
* FILES_UID - uid for all the files on unix-like systems
* FILES_GID - gid for all the files on unix-like systems

You can overwrite some dir paths. Set absolute or PWD relative path.
For production please prefer absolute paths.
By default, these paths will be under ROOT_DIR.

* APP_FILES_DIR - path to dir `/appFiles`
* APP_DATA_LOCAL_DIR - path to dir `/appDataLocal`
* APP_DATA_SYNCED_DIR - path to dir `/appDataSynced`
* CACHE_LOCAL_DIR - path to dir `/cacheLocal`
* CFG_LOCAL_DIR - path to dir `/cfgLocal`
* CFG_SYNCED_DIR - path to dir `/cfgSynced`
* DB_DIR - path to dir `/db`
* LOG_DIR - path to dir `/log`
* TMP_LOCAL_DIR - path to dir `/tmp`
* USER_HOME_DIR - path to dir `/home`
* EXT_DIRS - JSON object which specifies external dirs which are pointed to any
  external dir of local system. Like EXT_DIRS='{"myExtDir": "/home/userName/Downloads"}'.
  They have to be absolute. To call it use `/external/myExtDir/someFile.jpg`

## File structure

* `/appFiles` - app files after install are put here. They will be readonly
  * `/[appName]`
* `/appDataLocal` - apps data which is only for current machine
  * `/[appName]`
  * `/system` - for system services and drivers
* `/appDataSynced` - apps data which is synced between app user's devices
  * `/[appName]`
  * `/system` - for system services and drivers
* `/cacheLocal` - local cache for all the apps and system
  * `/[appName]`
  * `/system` - for system services and drivers
  * `/common` - for anyone
* `/cfgLocal` - local configs for all the apps and system
  * `/[appName]`
  * `/system` - for system services and drivers
  * `/common` - for anyone
* `/cfgSynced` - synced configs for all the apps and system
  * `/[appName]`
  * `/system` - for system services and drivers
  * `/common` - for anyone
* `/db` - all databases of all the apps and system here. They are synced by db engine
  * `/[appName]`

  This is the only dir which is accessible outside squidlet.
