## Rule

Every rule consist of:

* name - unique name of rule
* trigger section - it's listeners of events e.g device status. After any trigger fulfilled it will go to
  the next section.
* check section - it's full check to allow do actions or not.
* action section - it's list of actions to to after trigger and check sections are fulfilled.
* actionAsync - call actions step by step.
